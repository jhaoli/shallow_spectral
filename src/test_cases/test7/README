Test Case 7 - 500mb ECMWF Observed Data
---------------------------------------

Experiment 7 tests the full equations with semi-implicit time stepping.
For this experiment horizontal diffusion has been enabled.
The initial conditions are obtained from a NetCDF file that contains
normal mode initialized fields and reference solutions from a high
resolution run. The data are 500mb heights and winds of December 21, 1978.
The kinetic and potential energy spectra are plotted, and the conservation 
properties computed.  After one day, an error analysis is performed.
Contour plots of the height field have been enabled on a polar
stereographic projection with continental outlines.
The spectral coefficients of the model run are saved in the NetCDF 
file 'REF0007.cdf'.
