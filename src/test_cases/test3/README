Test Case 3 - Steady Zonal Flow with Compact Support
----------------------------------------------------

Experiment 3 tests the full equations with semi-implicit time stepping.
Contour plots of the height field have been enabled with
orthographic projection.
The flow has been rotated with respect to the coordinate axis by
an angle pi/2-0.05 radians.
The center of the viewpoint was changed to 45N and 90W.
