Test Case 5 - Zonal Flow over a Mountain
----------------------------------------

Experiment 5 tests the full equations with semi-implicit time stepping.
This case includes surface topography. The kinetic and potential
energy spectra are plotted, and the conservation properties computed.
Error analysis has been disabled.
Contour plots of the height have been enabled on a cylindrical projection
with continental outlines.
